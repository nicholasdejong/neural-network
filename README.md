## A Neural Network in Python.

## Up and Running
1. `git clone https://github.com/nicholasdejong/neural-network`
2. `python main.py`

## How to change it
The client code sits in `main.py.` You can add your own activation functions in `activation.py`. You can add your own cost function in `cost.py`. The API is still experimental.
